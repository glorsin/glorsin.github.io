            <h2>Personal Life</h2>
            <p>Dad has been my rock throughout my life, providing me the stability I needed.  He always made himself available to me, going the extra mile, literally.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When my husband and I first moved from Calgary, Canada, to Texas in 2002, there was confusion at the US border crossing with my husbandâ€™s visa paperwork.  My paperwork was cleared, and they said I was free to continue on alone. I had needed to be at work in Dallas within just a few days, but was driving a big 24' UHaul full of everything we owned.  I was not keen on doing that long 2000 mile drive in that beast all alone, my Dad dropped everything and came to my rescue.</li>
                <li>Another time I had to transition between Engineering co-op jobs immediately from Ottawa to Calgary (36 hour drive). Dad flew out to Ottawa from Edmonton just to drive my car to Calgary while I flew to my next job.</li>
                <li>On countless occasions, when I lived in Calgary, he would drive down from Edmonton (3 hr trip) to pick up and care for my dog when I would go on trips.</li>
                <li>He was always the traditional gentleman: opening the car door and every door for me, walking curbside along sidewalks, etc.</li>
                <li>He always made me feel important.</li>
                <li>From 8th grade through university, it was just Dad and me at home. He did a great job as a single Dad.</li>
            </ul>
